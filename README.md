# Not-Awesome-Survival
An MCGalaxy plugin I coded to see how far I could get with my own take on survival.

I no longer actively develop it.  Download ⬇️ Not Awesome Survival plugin Installation In order to run a server with NAS, it is heavily recommended that you start with a completely fresh MCGalaxy download.

This is because NAS has a bunch of custom blocks and configuration that WILL OVERWRITE what you had before.

You will also need to use the "infid" version of MCGalaxy_.dll which allows for 767 blocks. The download above already includes support for 767 blocks. 

To install:  Run your server once to generate the folders, if you haven't already.

Shut down your server. Put every file from assets.zip into the plugins folder.

Just the files inside! You should not end up with an "assets" folder inside plugins.

Run your server again. NAS will generate a starting world, then do one final restart automatically.

If this works without any errors, you're done!  Tips Press Q and E to move the selection on your toolbar.

Press R to toggle toolbar opened. Press M to move tools in the toolbar.

Press X to delete tools.  It is very difficult to properly undo theft and grief in NAS.

Therefore, the server is automatically set to whitelist-only by default.

To allow you and your friends to play, add players to the whitelist with /whitelist add [playername]+  It might be handy to change the spawnpoint of the main world, as it usually starts very high in the sky.

You can do so with /setspawn  If you have logs, you can place drawers to craft with

. Logs and drawers are a shared resource. Use /faq to see the crafting guide image.

What has been implemented:  Gathering limited blocks to build and craft with Crafting Tools Containers to store blocks and tools Custom gen and infinite maps (every world is a large "chunk") Custom block physics Health, fall damage, suffocation, death, and food.

What has -not- been implemented, and probably never will be unless someone else steps in.  Actual pvp Mobs A bunch of other stuff probably. 

Please don't bug me for new features.

Known issues (with unknown causes):  Rarely, storage containers will get erased. Rarely, the map data will get erased (no more cave fog...) Unknown issues:  Probably a lot of things.
